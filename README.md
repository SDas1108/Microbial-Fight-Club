This repository contains MATLAB code used to simulate 2-species competition,
logistic growth, and LV interaction dynamics as shown in my LinkedIn video.

Generalized Lotka Voltera Equation. Use it to simulate dynamical behaviour in poplation densities and fractions by selecting different growth rates, carrying capacities and interactions parameters.

Includes:
- Logistic growth model
- LV competition model
- Example parameters for Species 1 and 2
- Code for plotting for different initial mixing conditions
